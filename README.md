# TeamWork to Slack

#### Send a notification to Slack when a TeamWork task is completed.

Still under heavy construction. But if you want to try:

* Run composer install

* Copy config-example.php to config.php and fill in the correct credentials

* Point the TASK.COMPLETED webhook in Teamwork to the projects folder, i.e. http://www.example.com/projects/
